<h2>About This Website – My Dream Travel Destinations</h2>
<p>This website is a small but special project that reflects my passion for traveling and exploring the world. "My Dream Travel Destinations" is more than just a collection of cities—it's a window into the places I dream of visiting someday. Each destination on this site was carefully chosen because of its beauty, culture, and uniqueness. Through this project, I wanted to combine my love for travel with my interest in learning web development. Creating these pages gave me the chance to improve my HTML skills while also expressing my personal interests in a creative way. Whether it's the romance of Paris, the energy of Tokyo, the excitement of New York, or the rich history of Istanbul, each city has something that fascinates me. Even though I haven’t visited these places yet, building this website helped me feel more connected to them. I hope this project inspires others to dream big, explore new cultures, and maybe even start planning their own journeys around the world.</p>
